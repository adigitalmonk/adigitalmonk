Hi, I'm Brad. I like learning new things and making people's lives easier.

I maintain a simple website <https://agilebard.dev>; it's got some tools for working in an agile development team. Let me know what you think! I use my [adigitalmonk/agilebard.dev](https://github.com/adigitalmonk/agilebard.dev) repo as the issue tracker.

## Learning

When I can, I'm almost always working in Elixir. Recently, I've been learning how to solve problems with Rust. Trying out new languages and environments can be pretty fun.

## Projects

Feel free to check out any of my misc. public repos. They're mostly small hobby projects I used for trying out different things.

Here's a few that I had fun putting together.
- [adigitalmonk/depo](https://github.com/adigitalmonk/depo)
- [adigitalmonk/aurea](https://github.com/adigitalmonk/aurea)
- [adigitalmonk/cola](https://github.com/adigitalmonk/cola)
- [adigitalmonk/twenty-one](https://github.com/adigitalmonk/twenty-one)
